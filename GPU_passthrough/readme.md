1) In your PC/Laptop/Server BIOS make sure the following is enabled in the BIOS:

Intel VT-d & VT-x â€“ Intel Compatible list
All AMD CPUs from Bulldozer onwards should be compatible.

2) Get device IDs:
`lspci -nn`

3) Enable IOMMU in GRUB (check Intel or AMD commands below - choose the right one)
nano /etc/default/grub

`GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet intel_iommu=on iommu=pt"`

`GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet amd_iommu=on"`

Verify that IOMMU is enabled by running `dmesg | grep -e DMAR -e IOMMU` and looking for a line indicating it is enabled

Save and exit

4) run the command `"update-grub"` now reboot

5) Enable VFIO Modules
`nano /etc/modules`
Add the following modules:
```
vfio
vfio_iommu_type1
vfio_pci
vfio_virqfd
```
Then, save and exit

6) `update-initramfs -u -k all` and reboot

Verify the modules are enabled with `dmesg | grep -i vfio` and checking the driver version line is present

8) GPU Isolation From the Host (amend the below to include the IDs of the device you want to isolate)

`echo "options vfio-pci ids=10de:1381,10de:0fbc disable_vga=1" > /etc/modprobe.d/vfio.conf`

8) Blacklist GPU drivers (here are all that you would ever need)
```
echo "blacklist radeon" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf 
echo "blacklist nouveau" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf 
echo "blacklist nvidia" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf 
echo "blacklist nvidiafb" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
echo "blacklist nvidia_drm" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
```

Reboot your machine, be sure to use the web gui because with the gpu passed through you will no longer get video out.
The start up will begin but then appear to hang even though proxmox has started fine.

9) Create a new VM and add the GPU via hardware menu
You may need to set it as primary GPU
You may need to add a ROM BAR
